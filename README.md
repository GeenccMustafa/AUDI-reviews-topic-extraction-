# AUDI Reviews Topic Extraction

# Project README

## Description
This project contains two Jupyter Notebook files:
- **4_LDA_Topic.ipynb**
- **5_Topic_Extraction.ipynb**

## 4_LDA_Topic.ipynb
This notebook includes code for performing topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). It performs the following tasks:
- Data preprocessing including cleaning and lemmatization
- Building an LDA model
- Visualizing topics using pyLDAvis
- Evaluating model performance using Perplexity and Coherence Score
- Determining the optimal number of topics

## 5_Topic_Extraction.ipynb
This notebook contains code for extracting topics from text data. It includes the following tasks:
- Loading datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) including distribution of review lengths and word frequency analysis
- Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Visualizing topics using pyLDAvis

## Libraries Used
Both notebooks use various libraries including:
- pandas
- numpy
- re
- string
- spacy
- gensim
- pyLDAvis
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk
- scikit-learn

## How to Use
To use these notebooks, follow these steps:
1. Install the required libraries mentioned in the notebooks.
2. Download the datasets used in the notebooks.
3. Run the code cells in the notebooks sequentially to perform topic modeling and extraction.

## Files Included
- **4_LDA_Topic.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file for LDA topic modeling.
- **5_Topic_Extraction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file for topic extraction.

## Credits
The code in these notebooks is authored by Mustafa Genc.
